5. Getting Started Video:

5.1. In the video, how do I distinguish programming from computer science?

6.1. In the video, how do I define "dead code"?

6.2. In the video, what did I do that resulted in Python printing this error message:  "TypeError: unsupported operand type9s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int'"?

6.4. In the video, what is one reason I give for not using global variables?

7. Data and Expressions Video

7.1. What does pow(x,y) evaluate to?

7.2. What is the difference between x/y and x//y?

7.3. What do we mean by "Types affect semantics"?

7.5. Why is it that printing ((0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1) == 0.3) prints False and not True?

That's it.  We hope you had fun, learned a thing or two, and are now

Carpe diem!
