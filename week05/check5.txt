Edit this file and then submit it to autolab.

Be sure to watch the videos very carefully, and not just
skip ahead to the parts required to answer these questions!

Be *very brief* in your answers!  Seriously.  Brief.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Your full name and andrew id:

2. The full names and andrew id's of your groupmates.  Note that if you worked solo on this, then copy-paste the timestamp line from the email from the course instructor permitting you to do so.

3. Dates/times that you watched the videos listed in check5.html (fill this out as you go):

4. Total time this check required (fill this out when you are done):

5. Your well-thought-out questions, and answers, one per assigned video.

That's it!  Carpe diem!
